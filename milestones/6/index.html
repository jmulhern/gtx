            <h2>History of Joshua Tree</h2>
            <p>Joshua Tree, an iconic national park located in southeastern California, holds a rich and fascinating history that spans millennia.
                The area's human history dates back to at least 5,000 years, with evidence of Native American tribes, such as the Pinto Culture and the Serrano, who once inhabited this harsh desert environment.
                <br><br><img class="right" src="assets/joshua-tree.jpg" height="200" alt="desert with Joshua Tree plants">These indigenous peoples left behind rock art, pottery shards, and stone tools that offer glimpses into their ancient way of life, including their reliance on the park's unique flora and fauna for sustenance.

                <br><br>In the late 19th century, American settlers and prospectors began to arrive, drawn by the allure of mining opportunities. Mines for gold, silver, and other minerals dotted the landscape, and the remnants of these mining operations can still be explored within the park today.
